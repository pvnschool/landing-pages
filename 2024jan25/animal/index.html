 <p style="height: auto;">Squirrel are a family of rodents that includes marmots and chipmunks. Most squirrels are omnivores; they eat anything they find. Many kinds of squirrels live in trees, so they often find nuts. Despite living in trees squirrels are considered flightless because they can only jump short distances.</p>

 Monkeys are intelligent animals that are good at solving problems. Almost all types live together in groups. A monkey group commonly includes several related females, their young, and one or more males. Monkeys use facial expressions, body movements, and various noises to communicate with each other.

Penguins are flightless birds with flippers instead of wings. Their bodies are adapted for swimming and diving in the water, with some species able to reach speeds up to 15 miles per hour. Their body shape is fusiform (tapered at both ends) and streamlined, allowing them to be expert swimmers.
