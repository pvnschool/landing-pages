 <h1>THE LEGEND OF HANUMAN BIRTH AND CHILDHOOD STORY</h1>
 <img style=height:600px;width:60vw src=https://www.adgully.com/img/800/202108/iloh_poster_2b.jpg>
 <h2>Birth and Childhood of Hanuman
    Hanuman was the son of Kesari, a vanar, and the grandson of Brihaspati, the king of Sumeru. His mother Anjana, was an apsara of the heavens and had descended to the earth as human, due to a curse. She and her husband had performed 12 years of penance and intense prayers due to which, Shiva granted them a child, as a boon. The child was Hanuman himself, due to which he is also interpreted as the reflection or shadow of Lord Shiva himself. Other mythological accounts often called Hanuman, as the son of The God of Wind, Vayu Dev, due to the popular story of the Wind God delivering a sacred pudding to Anjana, which originated from King Dasharatha’s ritual of Putrakama Yagya. The same pudding was had by the three wives of King Dasharatha, leading to the birth of Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata and Shatrughna. This pudding was delivered to her while performing her prayers to Shiva, who steered the Vayu God’s energy into the womb of Anjana. Hence, Hanuman is popularly known as Vayuputra.
    
    Hanuman’s childhood tales are a source of great entertainment, told by grandmothers to the children. Hanuman was a very adventurous and restless child. He is believed to have mistaken the sun to be a ripe and mango, and he pursued it in order to eat it. Rahu, a Vedic planet, was also pursuing the Sun at that time for a scheduled eclipse, and Hanuman thrashed him in order to reach the Sun first. This angered Lord Indra, who struck Hanuman with a thunderbolt. Hanuman fell back to the earth, unconscious, and also damaged his chin, leaving a permanent mark on it. This incident enraged Vayu Dev, his father figure, who sucked out all the air from the universe. When all the humans and animals began to struggle for air, Lord Indra withdrew the effect of his thunderbolt, and revived Hanuman, and was also blessed with multiple boons, by the devas, to pacify the Wind God.
    
    Brahma provided Hanuman with the irrevocable Brahma’s curse, which ensures no one would be able to kill him with any weapon in war. He also blessed with the power of inducing fear in enemies, destroying fear in friends, and to be able to change his form to travel anywhere. Shiva blessed with the boons of longevity, scriptural wisdom, and the ability to cross the ocean, and also gave a band that would protect him for life. Lord Varuna blessed him with the boon of immunity from water. The Lord of Fire, Agni Dev, blessed him with the protection of burning by fire. Surya Dev gave him two blessings of yoga “laghima” and “garima”, using which he can attain the smallest or the largest form respectively. The God of Death, Yama, blessed him with the boons of health and immunity from weapons, thus securing him completely from death. Kubera, the treasurer of the Gods, blessed him with eternal happiness and satisfaction. Kamadeva, the Hindu God of love, blessed him to be free from lust, thus declaring him to be a celibate. His father also blessed him with even more speed. Hanuman then became of student of Surya, and acquired a great deal of knowledge from him. Hanuman then asked Surya to charge a guru dakshina from him, which he denied. However, Hanuman insisted a lot, and finally Surya asked him to help Surya’s spiritual son, Sugriva, as guru dakshina. Hanuman, then became Sugriva’s minister.</h2>
